# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to our project! We're excited to have you here and look forward to your contributions. This document provides guidelines for contributing to our project. By participating, you agree to abide by our code of conduct and these contribution guidelines.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to our project, including but not limited to:

- **Submitting bugs and feature requests**: If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature that could improve the project, please use our issue tracker to submit these.
- **Improving documentation**: Our project's documentation can always use improvement, whether it's fixing typos, clarifying sections, or adding new content.
- **Submitting pull requests**: Contributions to the codebase or documentation via pull requests are always welcome. Please follow the steps outlined below.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Make your changes**: Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. **Commit your changes**: Write clear and meaningful commit messages. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature" and "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
4. **Run the tests**: Make sure your changes pass all the tests (if applicable).
5. **Write or update tests**: If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. If you've changed APIs, update the existing tests.
6. **Ensure coding standards are followed**: Make sure your code lints (code standards/tools vary by project).
7. **Submit the pull request**: Include a clear description of the problem and solution. Include any relevant issue numbers.
8. **Review by maintainers**: Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Some back and forth conversation may be necessary, so be patient and open to feedback.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, include as much relevant information as possible, including:

- The version of our project you're using
- Any relevant configuration or environment information
- A clear and concise description of the issue

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests. Please:

- Use the issue tracker to submit feature requests
- Clearly and concisely describe the feature and its benefits
- Discuss the feature's applicability to the project's goals

## Questions and Help
